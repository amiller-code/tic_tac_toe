# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a Python game of Tic-Tac-Toe in a text format.

## Usage

To use this program, download the main.py file and run with a Python IDE or Command Line.

Once it has run, instructions and a blank Tic-Tac-Toe board will print. Follow the instructions to input your move (the program will ask you to re-input a move if it is not the correct format or has already been played) 

When the game is over (either 1 player wins or the players tie), the game will print a game over message and declare the winner or a tie, track the score of the series, then ask if you would like to play again.
  If you choose to play again, the board will clear and the player who is currently losing the series will play first.
